# Boston Crime Data Analysis
### Coursework: Computing for Analytics using Python: The course covered applied part of python used to do data analysis using machine learning algorithms.

#### Objective: 
To understand and compare the city’s demographics with its crime rate, analyse crime trends by crime type and explain the dependence of crime incidence to a varying number of factors.

#### Data Source:
The data relating to crime incidences recorded in Boston between 2015 and 2018 was obtained from Kaggle (“Crimes in Boston | Kaggle”), an extensive data resource reputed especially for its analytics competitions.

#### Approach: 
The study of Boston’s crime data starts with an exploratory analysis, which uses visual methods such as box plots, histograms and scatter plots to provide a snapshot of the relationships between various groups of independent and dependent variables. Post the exploratory analysis, analytical techniques such as regression analysis and K-means clustering further help identify possible correlations and identify groups organically.
